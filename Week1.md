Thai cuisine is characterized by a balance of sour, spicy, salty, sweet and bitter flavors. The materials used are mainly seafood, fruits and vegetables.
There are four major Thai cuisines, namely Northern Thai, Northern Thai, Thai Chinese, and Southern Thai, reflecting the different geography and culture of Sifang in Thailand, and the ingredients used everywhere are often the same as those in neighboring countries. Signature dishes include Tom Yum Kung (sour and sour seafood soup), coconut chicken tender chicken soup, curry fish cake, green curry chicken, mango fragrant rice and so on.
